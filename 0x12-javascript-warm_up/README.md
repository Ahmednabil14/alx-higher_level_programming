# JavaScript Warm Up

Welcome to the JavaScript Warm Up repository! This project contains a series of exercises designed to familiarize you with the basics of JavaScript, including scripting, variable declarations, control flow, and working with objects.

## Project Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js version  14.x installed on your system. You can install Node.js using the following commands:
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs


Additionally, you need to install `semistandard` globally to check for code quality:

npm install semistandard


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand why JavaScript programming is amazing.
- Execute JavaScript scripts.
- Declare and assign values to variables and constants.
- Differentiate between `var`, `const`, and `let`.
- Work with various data types in JavaScript.
- Implement conditional logic using `if`, `if...else` statements.
- Use comments effectively in your code.
- Assign values to variables.
- Utilize loops (`for`, `while`).
- Control program flow with `break` and `continue`.
- Define and use functions.
- Understand the scope of variables.
- Perform arithmetic operations.
- Manipulate dictionaries (objects).
- Import files using modules.

## Tasks

Each task within this repository corresponds to a specific concept or skill you need to master in JavaScript. The tasks range from simple exercises to more complex ones that involve scripting and manipulating data structures.

### Mandatory Tasks

These tasks must be completed to fulfill the requirements of the project:

- **First Constant, First Print**: Write a script that defines a constant and prints a message.
- **Three Languages**: Print three lines with different language descriptions.
- **Arguments**: Handle command-line arguments and print different messages based on their count.
- **Value of Argument**: Retrieve and print the first command-line argument.
- **Create Sentence**: Concatenate two arguments and print a sentence.
- **An Integer**: Convert a string to an integer and print it, handling errors gracefully.
- **Loop to Languages**: Use a loop to print language descriptions from an array.
- **I Love C**: Print a message a certain number of times based on the first argument.
- **Square**: Draw a square of a given size using the character 'X'.
- **Add**: Define a function to add two numbers and print the result.
- **Factorial**: Compute and print the factorial of a number recursively.
- **Second Biggest!**: Find the second largest number among command-line arguments.
- **Object**: Modify an object property's value.
- **Add File**: Create a module that exports a function for adding two numbers.

### Advanced Tasks

These tasks are optional but offer a deeper understanding of JavaScript concepts:

- **Const or Not Const**: Demonstrate the immutability of constants.
- **Call Me Moby**: Create a function that executes another function a specified number of times.
- **Add Me Maybe**: Increment a number and execute a callback function with the new value.
- **Increment Object**: Extend an object with a method to increment its value.


Good luck, and happy coding!
