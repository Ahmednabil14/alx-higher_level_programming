# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

This repository contains tasks for the Software Engineering Foundations course focusing on JavaScript objects, scopes, and closures.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js version  14.x
- semi-standard linter

To install Node.js, run the following commands:
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

To install semi-standard, run:
sudo npm install semistandard --global

## Task List

1. **Rectangle #0**: Create an empty `Rectangle` class.
2. **Rectangle #1**: Define a `Rectangle` class with a constructor accepting `w` and `h`.
3. **Rectangle #2**: Add validation to the `Rectangle` constructor to prevent creating rectangles with zero or negative dimensions.
4. **Rectangle #3**: Implement a `print()` method to visualize the rectangle.
5. **Rectangle #4**: Add `rotate()` and `double()` methods to manipulate the rectangle.
6. **Square #0**: Inherit a `Square` class from `Rectangle`.
7. **Square #1**: Extend the `Square` class with a `charPrint(c)` method to customize the character used to print the square.
8. **Occurrences**: Write a function to count occurrences of an element in a list.
9. **Esrever**: Implement a function to reverse a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.
10. **Log me**: Develop a logging function to track the number of arguments passed.
11. **Number conversion**: Create a number conversion utility that supports various bases.
12. **Factor index**: Write a script to create a new array where each element is its index multiplied by its value.
13. **Sorted occurrences**: Process a dictionary of occurrences to group them by occurrence count.
14. **Concat files**: Write a script to concatenate the contents of two files into a third file.
