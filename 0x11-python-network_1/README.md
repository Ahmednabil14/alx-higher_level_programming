# 0x11 Python - Network #1: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the 0x11 Python - Network #1 project, a pivotal part of the SE Foundations curriculum at Holberton School. This project is designed to deepen your understanding of Python scripting, back-end development, and API interactions, with a focus on network programming. Throughout this project, you'll be exploring the use of both the `urllib` and `requests` packages for making HTTP requests and handling responses.

## Project Overview

This project is structured into several tasks, each aimed at mastering a specific aspect of network programming in Python. The tasks include:

1. Fetching a status page using `urllib`.
2. Extracting a specific header value from a response.
3. Sending a POST request with an email parameter.
4. Handling HTTP errors and displaying error codes.
5. Repeating tasks 1-4 using the `requests` package.
6. Searching a user in a mock API using POST requests.
7. Fetching your GitHub ID using the GitHub API.
8. Listing the 10 most recent commits of a GitHub repository.
